NZ Native Plant Based Website Notes (Rongoa):

Breif:
I am going to create a website that informs users about NZ plants. The information and data should be displayed in a
entertaining and interactive way, with the site being accessible to a wide range of users on mobile or pc. The plant
pages should be automatically generated from JSON data contain all the information, it should be easy to update and edit
data.
